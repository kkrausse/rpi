notes on circuits

## Axioms

- Ohm's - V = IR

- Kirchoff's Current Law
  sum of currents entering a junction = sum of currents exiting a junction
  => 1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2 with parallel resistors R1 and R2 and total resistance R

- Kirchoff's Voltage Law
  Voltage drop of total circuit = sum of voltage drop of series components
  => Resistance of total = sum of resistence of series components

- Voltage drop is same accross all parallel parts of junction (amps differ)
